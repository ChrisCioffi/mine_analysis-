He replied that he had ""no objections, the areas look great"".  Mr. Beachy asked about removal of the haul road that goes through his property, I told him that the haul road will be narrowed up in the coming weeks, but will need to remain open for vegetation inspections, equipment transport for any additional reclamation and repairs, rill repairs and Bond Release Inspections. Mr. Beachy was frustrated when I told him that the haul road needed to be kept open for the five year Bond Release time period.  Any questions or concerns, please contact this inspector @ (301) 697-0344     "

The complaint last evening was that the property owner, Harland Sharpless, did not have any water in the well.  Randy had dropped a pebble in the well and according to him it hit the bottom of the well and it was dry. The Operator had Brenneman Well drilling at the site prior to our arrival.  They took water depths of the well and it was within similar depth when the well was drilled.  According to the records and the well cap when the well was drilled it produced 7 gpm of flow. After discussing the situation we decided to do a recovery test.  After completing the recovery test we discovered the well was only producing a half of gpm or less. Al and this inspector reviewed the permit area and Al took gps reading of the auger area and the approximate location of the last blast that was conducted on the site.  On September 22, after reviewing the complaint and permit review, Al Hooker, Chief of Permitting has determined that this mine site has reduced the recovery of this well and G & S Coal Company is to have the well drilled deeper, replace with a new well or a water source. This inspector will contact Tim Schwinabart by telephone and have him to provide a plan to Al Hooker by September 26, 2017 to include: 1) To construct by deepening the existing well, drill a new well or a water source to the resident. 2) The Operator has supplied drinking water to the residence, but with the understanding that if the well goes dry prior to the new or deepened well the Operator will supply the residence with a sanitized water buffalo.

Before going to his residence, Jeff Snyder and I reviewed the blasting records for January, 2017 and found them all to be in compliance with State and Federal laws.  Jeff Snyder, Ron Schartiger and I went to his residence and took pictures of the broken sewer line. The sewer line was cast iron and very rusty and was believed to have been installed in 1974 when the house was built. As we discussed with him, it appeared that the line broke due to the ground settling.  Mr. Slayton did no agree with my findings and requested to speak to the Mine Operator, Jody Ritchie about this problem.  I contacted Jody Ritchie and told him about the complaint and told him that our initial thoughts of the investigation were that the sewer line broke due to the ground settling and not due to blasting activities. Jody requested Mr. Slayton's phone number so that he could talk to him.   No further investigation on this complaint at this time.           "

I was contacted and went to the site to investigate and document the spring.  While on site I contacted my supervisor Tom Murray for advice.  He and the BOM Director John Carey and Jeff Snyder with the BOM Permitting section came to the site to observe and discuss what to do with the spring. Mr. Carey directed me to take water samples & photographs of the spring and document it on this inspection report. We then instructed the Contract Operator James Clark to capture the spring and pipe it off site with a 6"" PVC pipe. This spring is to be labeled as ""SP-1"" and is considered to be a pre existing spring. It is to be added to the required quarterly monitoring sites for this permit.  Kevin Clark, with ARJ, was contacted and made aware of the spring and the required new ground water monitoring site.  As per my last inspection report, ARJ needs to install the required Permit ID sign.     "

I was off on this date so Mr. Carey handled the complaint and immediately went to the mine site and inspected the county and state road conditions for fugitive dust. His findings were that dust was coming from the anti-skid material. When the anti-skid material dries out it becomes airborne as vehicles travel through the area. Mr. Carey's written findings for this complaint are attached to and made part of this inspection report.  Mr. Slayton's blasting complaint has been investigated before with no violation found.

A NOVO is being issued due to the non-compliant discharge reported on the DMR's as per the Operator. NOVO 461-170130-NOV is being issued and mailed to the Operator.

With what was visible (due to frozen and snow on the sumps and pond) the sumps are clearing up.  This appears to be working.

As weather allows take an additional sample and submit to this inspector.  Due to the pond being frozen and no discharge, this inspector could not take a sample. Removing coal this date, discussed the permit with the foreman Eugene Liller. No discharge observed this date.  The additional sumps and rip rap ditch as per the NOVO has been completed. Therefore; NOVO 461-170130-NOV is being terminated this date.  Monitor Pond 002 and if the clay and soils continue to be a problem you need to consider discussing with a chemical company for treatment.  If there are any questions feel free to contact this inspector.   "

An inspection on 12-29-16 resulted in water samples being taken below the MRU (Metal Recovery Unit) at the silt fence, adjacent to the perimeter marker. All Construction and Vindex Energy employees were working at the new treatment system. While performing a pump down procedure on a newly installed tank, the treatment system was overwhelmed, causing the MRU and a connecting pipe to be overtopped. This action allowed non-compliant water to leave the permit area at several locations. Water samples were collected and delivered to Geochemical Testing in Somerset PA for water analysis.  Today's office meeting is at the request of the Bureau of Mines. Vindex Energy was called in to discuss the SM-443 Coal Mine Permit, the cause of the incident, the results of the water samples and the schedule of completion for the water treatment system.  Several additional items were discussed during today's meeting; the MRU removal, the relocation of the existing treatment pond and the construction of a perimeter berm and roadway.  Results of the discussions are as follows;  The Bureau is requesting all construction at the new treatment system to be completed by April 10, 2017. (90 days)  The MRU's will be totally removed and abandoned by Wednesday January 11, 2017, as per Rodney Tichenell.  Work has begun on the relocation of the treatment pond, as per Rodney Tichenell.  When work on the relocated treatment pond is complete, Vindex Energy will begin construction on a perimeter road and berm to assure all water from the permit stays in the new treatment system.     A Notice of Violation and Order will be issued.  Please see the attached Laboratory Results and photographs of the MRU and connecting pipes overtopping.   "

The operator called Tom Murray and myself and requested that we come to the site and inspect a slide that had occurred on the downhill slope of the permitted Haul Road. An approximate 50' wide area has slid down the hillside taking the MSHA roadside berm with it. At this time, the Haul Road does not appear to have stress cracks, slumps or sliding present, all movement appears to be from the road edge and below. Tri-Star Mining was in progress of replacing the MSHA Berm during this inspection.  Initial Inspections reveal Pre-Law deep mine workings on the Barton Coal Seam directly above the Haul Road and the active slide area. These old mine workings appear to be the major contributing factor to the slide and the heavy saturation of the hillside below the Haul Road.  With this Field Inspection report, the Bureau is granting Tri-Star Emergency Authorization to shift the permitted Haul Road into the road cut to assure the safety of all traffic that is traveling on the Haul Road. As-Built Drawings and new Haul Road mapping will be submitted to the Bureau with next year's Annual Progress Maps.  This Field Inspection Report also authorizes Tri-Star Mining to divert several Pre-Law Deep Mine drainages from the slide area. A drainage control ditch will be constructed above the relocated Haul Road to capture any mine drainage and reintroduce it in the existing roadside ditch away from the slide area.  Daily Shift Inspections will be performed on the Haul Road by Tri-Star Mining and any changes will be reported immediately to Bureau upon discovery.  Tri-Star Mining will take all precautions necessary and utilize the ""Best Practices Possible"" to control erosion and sediment from leaving the site during the Haul Road relocation and construction.  Mike Garner will contact OSM to discuss a potential AML Project at the slide area.   Fugitive Dust and a non-durable road surface has become an escalating issue on SM-436. The operator will need to take action to control the fugitive dust and provide a durable road surface. Paving or tar-n-chip surfacing is recommended.  Any questions or concerns, please contact this inspector @ (301)697-0344.  "

Rills and gullies have been an ongoing issue on the Benard tract. The issues were discussed with the operator on multiple occasions. Tim Schwinabart agreed to placement of rip-rap stone in the larger rills and gullies and repairs on any other rills that are 9"" or more throughout the permit area. The operator agreed to have the repairs completed by the end of August, 2016.  In August, the operator removed several cutoff ditches and reclaimed some the affected areas. Although an attempt was made, rill/gully repair was not completed as directed by the deadline given.  During September's inspection, multiple existing rills and gullies were located throughout the Benard tract. A call was placed to the operator and direction was given to repair all rills and gullies by a new deadline of the end of September 2016.  In an attempt to assist the operator, I tied surveyors ribbon at several locations to assist the operator in rill and gully identification and repair.  I have offered to meet with the operator on sight to identify the trouble areas on multiple occasions.  The operator has been instructed to call me when repairs were completed so a follow up inspection could be scheduled. As of today's inspection, the operator has not contacted me to schedule an inspection.    A Notice of Violation and Order will be issued on SM-02-441.         COMAR 26.20.14.05.B states;  In addition, except on lands eligible for remining, the period of liability for a bond shall continue for a minimum period of not less than 5 years, beginning with the last year of augmented seeding, fertilizing, irrigation, or other work. The period of liability shall begin again when augmented seeding, fertilizing, irrigation, or other work is ordered by the Bureau to correct a failure to maintain the permanent vegetative cover required under COMAR 26.20.29 on the site.

On July 5, 2016, a landslide was located below the SM-436 Permit. The slide appears to be related to Pre-Law Mining and Acid Mine Drainage. Today's meeting is to discuss ideas and options of diverting clear water from the un-mined areas of Tri-Star's Permit SM-436 and the previously mined G&S Permit SM-430 to natural drain ways on the North facing slope of Hampshire Hill.  Years of Pre-Law Mining have left spoil piles, old high walls and many areas of Acid Mine Drainage and seeps downhill from Coal Mine Permit SM-436. The affected areas are on the Franklin and Barton Coal Seams. The area consists of steep slopes, unstable spoil piles and heavily saturated areas from Acid Mine Drainage Seeps from the Pre-Law Mining activities. The Abandoned Mine Lands Section of the Bureau of Mines has completed several AML Projects in the immediate area attempting to control several landslides along the hillside and have utilized the installation of Iron Slag Leech Beds sediment ponds to clean up some of the Acid Mine Drainage.  After discussing several ideas and options, the Operator and the Bureau of Mines decided that a Clear Water Diversion Ditch along the Little Pittsburgh Coal Seam Crop Line will be installed in conjunction with a series of Clear Water Traps at the Eastern permit boundary to regulate the flows of clear water during heavy rain falls and snow melt from the un-mined areas of the Tri-Star SM-436 Permit and the previously mined G&S SM-430 Permit. The discharge of the clear water will be a controlled discharge and directed to a natural drain way instead of introducing additional water to the areas that are affected by the Pre-Law Mining and Spoiling.

Mr Jacobs stated that runoff from permit 440 had entered his house. A rainfall event occurred last evening at around 8pm in excess of two inches. This quantity of water appears well beyond the capacity of the county road ditch. We observed that velocities were sufficient to blow the stone rip-rap liner out of several long  sections of the road ditch near the residence. It appears that excessive stone is present for the volume of ditch available. This may have contributed to flooding in the lower level of the basement. There was also damage from flooding to an upper level room. This was from water in the back yard originating from an invert in the woods upgrade from the house. It is estimated that approx. 10 acres of revegetated mine land out of a  total of  20 acres of land are in the contributing drainage area.

On this date I met with Al Hooker, Mark Hajas and Ted Schwinabart to investigate the seep that has developed in the backfill. Three samples were taken for analysis; S-1 at the start of the seep, S-2 where it is concentrated into a natural ditch that flows down beside the topsoil pile to Ditch #1, and S-3 which is on the east side of the pond road and flows into the east pit and then to Pond #1.  Until sample results are received and studied to make a conclusion, construct a ditch which will catch all of S-1 and direct it to a constructed sump and let it discharge into the existing natural ditch. Set up treatment at the discharge of the sump and monitor weekly taking samples (before treatment) and keep normal field sampling records. The samples need to include pH, flow, iron, manganese, suspended solids, acidity, alkalinity, aluminum, specific conductance, dissolved solids and sulfate. Submit the lab analysis sheet by e-mail to Al Hooker and me. If you have any questions contact this Inspector or Mr. Hooker.  There are rills, washes, bare areas and a highwall slump that need repaired soon to avoid a violation. These areas have been marked with flags in the field.

Joe questioned Nick about their method of measuring flows. Nick responded stating that a weir is used to measure the flows and that the weir is put in place each time flows are measured. Also the weir is not left in place until the next sampling period because it would get covered up with debris because of the wooded area and it will get coated with iron residue. Also there is concern that the bears will displace and break the weirs up.   While there, Joe walked up the UNT to the headwaters of Moore's Run and collected a sample.

His residence is located at 12905 Vale Summit Rd., Frostburg, MD  21532.  Mr. Slayton called and complained about a 6' crack in his ceiling and that there is black dust on his house, vehicles and lawn furniture. Also he claims that his voice has been messed up for the past six months and the dust is having an effect on his health.  BOM Inspector Ron Schartiger and I met with Mr. & Mrs. Slayton at their residence on this date.  At first we discussed the crack issue. I explained to them that there were three separate seismographs recording all blast that are conducted at the Cabin Run mine site. The peak particle velocity (ppv) readings are well below the maximum limit allowed by State and Federal Law. Secondly we looked at outside of the house, vehicles, porch rugs, lawn furniture and shrubbery. There was a considerable amount of visible dirt/dust on everything outside which he believes is coming from the Cabin Run surface mine site. I explained that there is at least two other sources of possible contributories of fugitive dust because of the location of their residence, which is located at the intersection of Maryland Route 36 and Vale Summit Road. This intersection is a heavy traffic area and the active county landfill site is located within 1/2 mile of their residence. At the conclusion of our conversation I stated that I would meet with Vindex personal to investigate and discuss their problem. Mr. Slayton requested that I have someone from the mining company contact him so that he could voice his opinion with them.  Ron and I then went to the mine site to do an inspection and investigation due to the complaint. There were no visible signs of fugitive dust leaving the site during the inspection. We then met with the day shift foreman to discuss the complaint and advised him that the complainant has requested to meet with their company officials concerning his complaint.  On 12/14/2015 I met with Vindex Energy Officials Thomas Jones, Rodney Tichinel and Nick Riggins at the mine site to discuss the complaint and any additional measures that could be implemented to control fugitive dust that is generated by the heavy truck traffic going to and from the Cabin Run surface mine site, noting that there are other sources not associated with the mining site that are contributing to the problem. Some of the possible solutions that were discussed were, sweeping the intersection of Cabin Run Road and Route 36 and washing the pavement of Cabin Run Road while the roads are closed during blasting. We also discussed the installation of a wheel-wash at the mine site. At the conclusion of our meeting I requested that Mr. Jones prepare a chronology of the cooperative steps that have been taken to reduce fugitive dust generated by the mining operation and any additional plans that may be put in place for the further reduction of possible fugitive dust. He is to submit the chronology to this Inspector. Also Mr. Jones stated that they were meeting with Mr. Slayton to address his complaint.  Monitoring this site for fugitive dust is standard procedure for monthly inspections.  No further action concerning this complaint is needed at this time.      "

Mine is active. Coal is stockpiled and is being trucked off of site. The treatment systems looks good with no issues noted.  A spring has surfaced along the Haul Road just north of the access road to the new water treatment system. The spring has saturated the Haul Road and has washed coal fines and sediment down the road surface which in turn is being deposited onto Durst Road from the coal truck traffic. The entire length of Durst Road from the mine entrance to Rt 495 is covered in dirt, dust and gravel. I had placed a call to the Mine Office to have the sweeper truck begin cleaning the road surface.  As the water ran down the Haul road surface, it could not flow to the drainage controls. The drainage ditch for that area of the roadway flows to Pond #003. It had sediment build up in the inlet which allowed the surface water to run down to the road culvert, through a sediment trap (that was full) and spill into the county maintained roadside ditch along Durst Road that flows to the North Branch of the Casselman River. The water was laden with coal fines and sediment. Samples were taken.  The Mine sent two men and a Skid-Steer Loader out to redirect the flow of the spring water. An attempt was made to re-open the drainage control ditch inlet, but the inlet was too narrow for the Skid-Steer to open the ditch as needed.     I placed a call to DJ Elliott, Engineer for Maryland Energy Resources, and instructed him to have the road graded, sloped and capped with clean stone by Monday, December 7, 2015.

His residence is located at 13710 New Georges Creek Rd., Frostburg, MD  21532.  Mr. Arnold called Mr. Larrimore and complained that dust is blowing off the Cabin Run Mine and onto his property. He also stated the he believes that they are hauling in illegal reject material (from the Mt. Storm wash plant) and stockpiling it on site and when it dries out it blows onto his property.  I first went to the mine site and spoke to Vindex Energy Mine Superintendent Rodney Tichinel. We traveled the mine site and looked at the reject pile in question. I ask for their cooperation in grading the reject pile to reduce the elevation of the pile so that it will not be visible to Mr. Arnold. He agreed and said that it would be taken care of first thing tomorrow.  I contacted Mr. Arnold and discussed his complaint. I told him that no reject material was be hauled in from the Mt. Storm wash plant. He did not believe me though. We discussed the reject pile located on the Cabin Run site and how it is being used. He doesn't believe they are hauling much of it because he can't tell that the pile is being reduced. I then told Mr. Arnold that I spoke to Rodney and that the pile would be graded down tomorrow and would not be visible to him anymore. He said that would be ok and that was what he wanted.  No further action is needed concerning this complaint.   "

The reviews of the blasting records indicate that the PPV's are well below the allowable limits set forth by State and Federal laws.  On this date Jeff Snyder and I visited the residence and investigated the alleged blasting damage complaint. This residence had a pre-blast survey completed on 2/24/2015 that showed cracks in the basement block wall mortar joints. The cracks that the home owner is concerned about are also in the block wall mortar joints. Mr. Keating stated that he thinks the cracks have gotten worse since the pre-blast survey was done.  We explained that the operator is in compliance with the blasting limits set forth by law and the history of how the limits were established. We also explained that the cracks in the block wall mortar joints, that were documented in the pre-blast survey and presumed to be getting worse, are due to normal settling of the foundation. Mr. Keating was advised that if he was not satisfied with my findings he could contact the Director of the BOM John Carey for another opinion.  No further investigation is needed concerning this complaint at this time.   "

Mr. Engle phoned in a complaint stating that dirt and flyash is blowing off the mine site and onto his vehicles, barn and house. I called Mr. Engle and discussed his complaint. He said that the dust & dirt was mainly gray in color and felt that it was flyash and he was concerned about his and his girlfriends' health. I explained to him that Vindex was taking all reasonable actions, such as watering the interior rock truck haulage roads and additionally the use of water cannons to control fugitive dust during the truck loading of overburden in the Sewickly pit area and the truck loading of coal refuse at the stockpile area. I also explained that the flyash comes in from the AES Warrior Run plant with a certain percentage of moisture to help keep it from becoming airborne and as per their approved permit the ash is to be covered daily with backfill material. Air Quality has also made site visits to the mine because of complaints of fugitive dust and found the site to be in compliance with State Laws.  I will continue to monitor the site.  No further action is needed for this particular complaint.  "

Liners have been installed in Treatment Cells A and B. A vacuum truck is on site today cleaning Treatment Cell C; the liner for Cell C is scheduled to be installed on Monday September 28th.  Pond 001-B has an area of seepage that has gotten progressively worse over the past several months. The area is at the base of the breast just above the Outfall 001-B Building. The seepage has progressed from a seep to a flow with piping present along with heavy saturation of the base of the breast. The Bureau of Mines has directed the operator to install a liner in Pond #001-B.  Dave Bowers asked if the Bureau of Mines would consider water samples to assist in identifying that the water that is coming out of the Pond #1-B embankment in not mine water but is from another source. This inspector agreed to review the sampling results and any other documentation the MER would like to provide, but until the sample results are provided and ample time is given for review, MER will continue on the schedule that was set forth  in Field Report DM-113-150916-FIR to have the liner installed in Pond #001-B  As per the approved Coal Mining Permit, if the mine is idle for more than 30 days, the operator will make preparations and begin work on the Mine De-Watering Well.  Pond #001 is discharging @ 180 GPM, pH-7.5.      The operator had discussed with the Bureau adding a new meter to the discharge line coming from the mine, this is to allow for accurate monitoring of all water that is being pumped from the mine to the surface. The operator will install the new meter as discussed, before mine start up.  Maryland Energy resources will contact this inspector before any coal production begins.

Mr. Arnold called BOM Director John Carey and complained that dust from a visible coal stock pile (refuse stock pile) was causing a problem at his residence. He stated that they have to clean the patio and pool every time they want to use them.   Mr. Carey contacted me to discuss the complaint. We reviewed the other recent complaints made by Mr. Arnold and discussed my findings that concluded that the site is in compliance with our laws. Because of the complaints I have required additional fugitive dust control measures which include watering the area and use of a water cannon during truck loading activities at the refuse stockpile area and that no additional coal or refuse may be stockpiled in that particular area.   I also advised Director Carey that Mr. Arnold has made complaints to ARMA Inspector Tamara Davis about fugitive dust problems. She has made several inspections at the site and investigated dust complaints filed by Mr. Arnold. We called Miss Davis and spoke to her about the complaints on this site that she has investigated. She replied that the site has been investigated for fugitive dust complaint's and found to be in compliance during her inspections.    On this date I observed the site from a high vantage point. Interior haulage roads were being watered. The active overburden removal area was creating some fugitive dust in the pit area but it did not appear to be leaving the permit area.   I will continue to monitor the site for fugitive dust problems.  No further action is needed for this particular complaint.     "

The cells were required to assist in the treatment of mine water before it discharges at Outfall 001.Today's inspection is to address several concerns that are associated with the three new treatment cells as well as several concerns with existing Pond 001, Cell B.  Treatment Cell A has an area of seepage at the base of the breast embankment. It is unable to retain water.  Treatment Cell B has an area of high saturation, an area of slide, an area of slumping and a crack that runs almost the entire length of the breast. It is unable to retain water.  Treatment Cell C has a small area of saturation at the breast an area in the cut slope of the cell that appears to be a sink hole and a crack that is perpendicular to the breast.  Pond 001-B has an area of seepage that has gotten progressively worse over the past several months. The area is at the base of the breast just above the Outfall 001 Building. The seepage has progressed from a seep to a flow with piping present along with heavy saturation of the base of the breast.  After visual observation by the Bureau of Mines, the Bureau has determined that Pond Liners will be required at all three treatment cells and in Pond 001-B.    As of Friday September 11, 2015, the mine is idle, so therefore, you are directed make any needed repairs to the treatment cells and to have the new liners installed in Treatment Cells A and B before the mine starts back into production. Treatment Cell C will have a liner installed within two weeks after mine start up.  A liner will be installed in Pond 001-B within four weeks of mine start up.  As per the approved Coal Mining Permit, if the mine is idle for more than 30 days, the operator will make preparations and begin work on the Mine De-Watering Well.  The operator had discussed with the Bureau adding a new meter to the discharge line coming from the mine, this is to allow for accurate monitoring of all water that is being pumped from the mine to the surface.

Pond 001 is discharging, pH-8.4, Specific Conductance-500 and 69 degrees. The flow is 81 GPM. Roads are being swept today. Mining is in progress. Coal is stockpiles and is being trucked off site.  As of August 19, 2015, the three new treatment cells have been operational. The cells were required to assist in the treatment of mine water before it discharges at Outfall 001. The three treatment cells appear to have some issues with seeps, cracks and inability to hold water. The Bureau instructed MER to have their engineers to assess the new treatment cells and make any needed repairs.  The operator had discussed with the Bureau adding a new meter to the discharge line coming from the mine, this is to allow for accurate monitoring of all water that is being pumped from the mine to the surface. Either a new system of monitoring is required or the existing system needs to be re-calibrated.  Any questions or comments, please contact this inspector, Ron Schartiger, @ (301) 687-0344   "

Ted has requested to reverse approximately 500' of fresh water Ditch A because he believes that the undisturbed surface and ground water that is entering the fresh water ditch is infiltrating into the backfill and causing a problem. After reviewing this in the field I feel that he may be correct and I am approving the fresh water drainage ditch modification. This modification is for the 0-500' of Ditch A which will be reversed to run west to an undisturbed section of the permit area. This reversed section of ditch must end on the undisturbed permitted section on the west side of the permit in a stable area and/or be protected by a rock outlet.  Continue backfilling and adding large amounts of alkaline material.  There can be no additional mining/coal removal until the site is backfilled and planted up to the pond access road which will make the site compliant with contemporaneous reclamation.

Mr. Arnold has a mason on site making repairs to the bricks and basement wall.   I compared my pictures to the pictures in the Blast Survey that was conducted on his residence in 2002. I explained to Mr. Arnold that Vindex Energy is and has been in compliance with their blasting activities and that the blasting limits, which are in place by law, would not cause the damage that he is suggesting. Mr. Arnold understood what I was explaining to him but did not agree. Before leaving Mr. Arnold requested to have the mining company contact him concerning this issue. I talked to Rodney about the complaint and told him about my findings and that Mr. Arnold wanted to speak to someone from the mining company. Rodney will pass the request on to company officials.

Mr. Robertson complained that it was very dusty on Rt. 36 near the Landfill and stated that he almost wrecked his truck because of the dust. In my investigation it is noted that a shot had been put off just before this incident and caused a cloud of dust, which is normal during blasting activities. I called Mr. Robertson and explained my findings and that Vindex Energy has a fugitive dust control plan which they are to follow during mining and blasting activities. In their plan one of the conditions is that they monitor weather conditions, including wind direction so that the shot can be fired at a favorable time that will minimize any affects of fugitive dust. He said he understood that, but this issue was much worse than normal. I advised Mr. Robertson that I will notify the company of his complaint and I will remind them of the conditions in their fugitive dust control plan.        "

Also on this date BOM Director John Carey, Tom Murray, Ron Schartiger and I met on site with Vindex Energy staff to discuss a temporary location to screen rations. This was approved for a six week period beginning this date and to end on 5/27/2014 as long as no fugitive coal dust problems occur.  Your are reminded to use good judgment not to operate this equipment during dry and/or windy day.  While on site we also reviewed the backfill and the area being prepared for revegetation. It was discussed that some of the area being used to park equipment should also be backfilled and reclaimed to stay in compliance with contemporaneous reclamation.      "

This has become an environmental and public safety issue. Trails that have been created by the 4 wheelers and dirt bikes have destroyed some of the vegetation on reclaimed areas and pond embankments.  These areas will need to be repaired. Recently a pickup load of household debris has been dumped near Pond #4. As we reviewed the debris a bag of household garbage was discovered and a prescription bottle was found inside. The prescription bottle had a name and address on it. Rusty said they would contact the authorities with the information to see if anything could be done about it and the trespassing issue.  4 wheelers and dirt bikes have been riding dangerously close to the highwall edge. Rusty, Grant and I walked the entire highwall and discussed cutting down tree across the trails to stop them from riding along the highwall. Rusty is to see that this gets done.  This site has two entrance points with locked gates. It was discovered that the pickup truck gained entrance by going around the secondary entrance gate (green gate).  Rusty is to see that this area is blocked.  As far as 4 wheeler and dirt bikes, there are numerous access points and it will be difficult if not impossible to stop them without 24 hr. security.  They are also riding dangerously close to the edge of the highwall. These areas will need repaired.

Coal is being stockpiled on the site.  Pond #1 was frozen and not discharging. Recently during a rain event the pond had discharged with obvious coal fines noted at the discharge outlet. This was due to the water level being frozen below the discharge inlet and allowed the coal fines from the stockpiled to be suspended and carried across the frozen pond and out the discharge pipe. However the pond does appear to be almost at its designed sediment storage capacity and needs cleaned.  The following maintenance must be completed within two weeks to avoid a violation; 1. The pond must be cleaned and the coal fines below the discharge outlet must be cleaned up. 2. The internal sump on the south side of the permit area needs enlarged and cleaned.

From here we proceeded to Pond 009 and sampled and conducted a field pH of 8.89.  Pond 009 discharges into a Trib to the South Fork of Sand Run which the water flowing in this trib was real muddy, Joe collected a sample and we investigated up stream to the problem area.  Adjacent to the road was sumps and the one was collecting water from the road way.  The grader was grading the road way and the thawing ( the temperature at Aaron Office was 42 degree Fahrenheit) was causing run off.  At the sump at the area to access Pond 005 was discharging muddy water into the Trib.  Within minutes of finding the situation Aaron contacted the contractor and a backhoe was at the site to clean the sump.  At this time I advised Aaron there would be a NOVO issued.  Within an hour or so we revisited the area and the sump was partially clean and the sump was not discharging and the Trib was clearing up and the muddy water was about gone.

She stated that a severe blast occurred on 9/16/2014 around 13:45 - 13:50 and caused the drywall to crack. She also discussed a dust problem that is coming from the job.  I contacted Vindex Energy Mine Superintendent Rodney Tichinel and advised him of the complaint and requested a copy of the seismograph reports for this particular blast. Mr. Tichinel e-mailed the requested seismograph reports. The seismograph reports showed a max. ppv of 0.14 and a peak air pressure of 119.9 dB. These readings a well below the allowable limits set forth in State and Federal regulations. I contacted Mrs. Slayton and reviewed my findings with her. She stated that she would like for us to take some seismograph readings at her residence. I told her we would.  On 9/18/14, Jeff Snyder met with Mr. Randy Slayton at their residence to discuss the complaint and to install the Bureau's seismograph near the house to record today's blast.  Mr. Slayton indicated to Jeff that the blast on 9/16 had extended an existing crack that been created from previous blasting located in the living room ceiling.  Jeff was then shown a repaired crack in the back of the house exposed block basement wall.  Mr. Slayton next indicated that when it rains hard they get water into the basement from the wall in the front of the house (front wall is total below surface grade and is finished on the inside).  The blast went of at 12:31 pm; the Bureau seismograph recorded ground vibration of 0.065 in/s PPV and air over pressure of 109.5 dB.  Because the blast today was only 12 holes and not a normal production shot, Jeff informed Mr. Slayton that we would come back out to monitor when the next production shot is scheduled. This investigation will be continuing with a review of the Pre-Blast Survey that was conducted at this residence on 1/29/2013 and Jeff and I will monitor the next production shot, at their residence.

PERMIT VERIFICATION Mettiki Coal, LLC Discharge Permit renewal became effective as of October 1, 2010.  It will not expire until September 30, 2015.  Reminder the NPDES Permit expires September 30, 2015, submittal of the renewal needs to be submitted to the Baltimore Office by September 30, 2014.        RECORDS AND REPORTS Mettiki Coal, LLC is required to submit a monthly Discharge Monitoring Report.  (General Condition II-A.2).  In addition they are required to maintain a logbook of inspections and maintenance of their treatment system. The following is a list of documents on hand as requested by this inspector: Instrument Calibration Logbook Discharge permit Discharge Monitoring Reports Emergency Response Plan Instrument Calibration Logbook Operations Logbook Operator's Certification Material Safety Data Sheet Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (Updated October 2010), recommend to update with the renewal of the NPDES Permit Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan (Updated September 2010), recommend to update with the renewal of the NPDES Permit. OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE Wastewater discharge by the Mettiki Operation consists of mine drainage, Preparation Plant Wastewater, and Storm Water run off. Mine Drainage water and some of the storm water is treated at an Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) facility.  Runoff not treated at the AMD plant is treated in sediment basins.  The water there is treated with soda ash and caustic when needed.  Preparation Plant wastewater is periodically discharged to a series of ponds, which in turn discharge to the AMD Plant.  The AMD Plant was built in 1998.  The system consists of a Neutralization/Aeration Tank and one large Clarifier.  The Clarifier overflows into one of the old settling basins and then to a Polishing Pond.  The new treatment lines use the high density sludge process which circulates lime from the Clarifier back to the Neutralization/Aeration Tank.  Polymer is injected between the two.  The Polishing Pond outlet is defined as Outfall 002. Sludge generated at the AMD plant is discharged to a sludge tank and mixed with de- sulfurized solids from a nearby power plant and Preparation Plant sludge.  It is then pumped through a pipe underground to abandoned ""C"" Mine. A SUMMARY OF THE VISIT TO EACH PERMITTED OUTFALL FOLLOWS:  Outfall 001- This outfall is a sediment basin located below the active refuse disposal area.  There was no discharge at this location.  Wastewater from this location flows to a borehole where it is transferred underground to the AMD Plant for treatment.  This basin requires routine maintenance and has recently been cleaned.  Outfall 002 - This outfall is located below the Polishing Pond at the AMD Plant.  Flow and pH were measured and recorded at this location as 8.1 pH, 1510 Conductance and 58.7 degree Fahrenheit with 10.61 mgd.   An inspection of the Office and Treatment Plant found them clean and organized.  Outfall 005- This outfall is a sediment basin spillway located below a stabilized coal refuse pile. There was no discharge at this location.  Wastewater from this location is pumped to the AMD Plant for treatment.  Outfall 006 - This outfall is the last in a series of three cells (basins) located below the Coal Preparation Plant.  There was no discharge at this location.  Wastewater from this location is pumped to the AMD Plant for treatment.  The cells are routinely dredged of fines that are transported to a refuge pile for disposal.  The sumps along the roadway appear to receive routine maintenance and they have recently been cleaned.  Outfall 007 - This sediment basin receives runoff from the ""A"" Mine yard.  The discharge of this outfall field tested 9.90 pH with 1870 Conductivity and 64.5 degree Fahrenheit.  This outfall is allowed up to 10 pH for treatment of manganese.  Outfall 008 - This outfall is a sediment basin receiving runoff from ""B"" Mine yard and the active refuse area.  This mine is now closed. There was no discharge at this location during the day of this inspection.  Wastewater from this location is injected to a borehole between the basin and Outfall 001 and flows underground to the AMD plant where it is pumped for treatment.  This location is just below a reclamation area.  Outfall 009 - This outfall receives water from the sediment basin below the Breaker Plant.  No discharge was observed at his location. Outfall 010 - This outfall is a sediment basin located opposite the preparation plant.  There was no discharge at this location.  Wastewater from this location is first pumped to 006 where it is then pumped to the AMD Plant for treatment.  Outfall 012 - This outfall receives storm water run off and oil/water separator effluent only.  There are three cells at this location, ""A"",""B"", and ""C"".  The discharge of this outfall field tested 8.0 pH with 1320 Conductivity and 62.8 degree Fahrenheit.  SELF MONITORING PROGRAM  Flow Measurement  With the exception of Outfall 002, flow at the remaining outfalls is measured by determining the time required to fill a 5 gallon bucket.  The results are converted and reported as gallons/minute. A Siemens Totalizer, Chisel Strip Chart Recorder and ultrasonic flowmeter automatically measures and records flow at Outfall 002 only.  Sampling  An Isco Automatic Sampler collects 8-hour flow proportioned composite samples at Outfall 002 only.  An Ertco, #1387, mercury thermometer recorded a refrigerated temperature of 4oC during the day of this inspection. Laboratory  Wastewater analysis for  Mettiki Coal, LLC is contracted to two independent laboratories. Wastewater samples are normally analyzed by Standard Laboratories of Belington, W VA, and Sturm Environmental Laboratories of Bridgeport, West Virginia, are used on certain occasions.  During my inspection, I reviewed the Laboratory Analysis Sheets and found them to be complete with analyst, outfall, water quality parameter, standard method of testing, sample preservation, results, dates and times of the testing.  Chain of custody was maintained.  Storm Water Pollution Plan  The Mettiki Coal, LLC Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan was available for my inspection.  INSPECTIONS AND FINDINGS OF THE NPDES DICHARGE INSPECTION:  (1) I observed the general condition of the facility's outfalls to be in good order.  All outfalls were adequately maintained.  Ponds and basins appeared sound and secure. (2) There were no unusual odors at any of the outfalls inspected.

At 08:17 I contacted BOM Acting Director Al Hooker and briefed him of the situation.  After reviewing the accident seen at daylight, the MSHA Order was modified to allow the operator to implement the ""Bulldozer Recovery Plan"" dated 8/7/14. All equipment used in rescue operations were released from this order with the exception of the Cat D11 Dozer #048, involved in the accident. Once this dozer is recovered it may be moved to a safe location within the pit where it will remain under order, preventing any work or movement of the dozer until MSHA can inspect the machine.  When Mr. Bosley returned to the mine site after being evaluated at the hospital, MSHA conducted an interview with him. He stated that he thought that he was pushing an access off the shot material down to the Tyson bench.  At the conclusion of our investigation it was determined that the operator was working to close too the highwall edge and had mistaken where he was trying to make access down to the Tyson bench.  This investigation is complete except for the recovery of the Cat D-11 dozer. Vindex Energy Mine Superintendent Rodney Tichinel is to contact this Inspector when the recovery of the D-11 dozer is in its final stages.  The cooperation between Vindex Energy Staff, MSHA and the local Fire/Rescue Departments was excellent. This made for a good outcome of an extremely dangerous rescue operation that resulted no serious injury or loss of life.      "

The 10 feet area for the grass apron has begun, not seeded and mulched, this is scheduled when seeding and mulching occurs on the other disturbance.  Rip rap has been placed in the emergency spillway and is scheduled to be completed.   2) Fix linear crack approximately about half way out the breast of pond.  According to Ted the weather has not cooperated and is scheduled to be completed, it has rained the last 4 out of 5 days.  3) Install 90 degree elbow on discharge pipe.  Elbow is ordered and expected to be in on Thursday of this week.  4) Place 10 feet of rip rap out pond bottom of each entrance channels. Entrance channel for Ditch 3 is completed.  5) Regrade Ditch 3 with a minimum of 18 inch free board as per the approved permit, one portion of the ditch has almost silted in with sediment washed from the rough backfill.  This ditch has been regraded and the 18 inch freeboard is there, but gullies from the backfill are starting to silt in the ditch.  Recommend for the operator to regrade the backfill area and place diversion ditches to prevent this from reoccurring.  Ditch again needs to be regraded and there is a pool of water in the ditch line and it is also silting in, the ditch needs positive drainage to prevent this from happening.  It could be a continuing problem if you don't have positive drainage. Seed and mulch when completed.  6) Ditch on south end of pond, near Increment IV, needs regraded, seeded and mulched.  This hasn't been done, possible it wasn't gotten due to the rains.   As the work is completed grade, seed and mulch any disturbance and also below the pond where the equipment has been trammed.         Reviewed Pond 004 area: As per the last inspection, at the area water is leaving the pit the operator is to remove the material from that area and construct a sump with a rip rap discharge.  This has been completed and looks good.  The silt fence below the disturbance is doing its job by collecting the sediment and coal fines.  The silt fence in areas has sediment and coal fines built up about half way, clean sediment and coal fines from the silt fence and keep the silt fence tight and other maintenance if needed. According to Ted he had explained to the equipment operator and thought it was completed.  It is apparent it wasn't completed, schedule to complete as weather allows.  Also discussed with Ted to repair gullies on the Planting Report 9, on Increment I on the Bakerstown and Harlem Coal Seam areas and the area On Increment II that was just planted last year, that is also on the Bakerstown Coal Seam area.

The site is active with mining in the Western portion of the permit. Backfilling is contemporaneous at both the Eastern and Western portions of the permit and there are several areas that are being prepared for seeding and mulching. Coal is being blended and loaded out at the Coal Yard. All DMR's are current and appear in good order.  On 6/9/14, The Bureau of Mines received a complaint from Mr. Mark Beachy, one of the surface owners of SM-00-436. Mr. Beachy was irate and is demanding that all mining on his property cease, all backfilling is to be completed, all equipment, fuel tanks and haul roads to be removed within 30 days. Mr. Beachy also stated that the next time his house ""rattles"" from a shot; he will be calling in another complaint. Bureau of Mines Compliance and Enforcement Supervisor, Tom Murray took the complaint.  On 6/10/14, Bureau of Mines Lead Inspector, Ralph Mongold called Mr. Beachy to address his complaint, Mr. Beachy was very adamant about having Tri-Star Mining removed from his property. In order to assist in defusing the situation and at Mr. Beachy's request, Bureau of Mines Director, John Carey called Mr. Beachy and received the same responses that were given to Tom Murray and Ralph Mongold.           Surface Mine SM-00-436 is active and currently in compliance with the Maryland Bureau of Mines. All mining on Mr. Beachy's property is complete and only backfilling, re-grading and planting remain. The open pit will remain until Tri-Star Mining mines through the neighboring SM- 01-440 as a Contract Miner under G&S Coal. To date, Tri-Star has been working five to six days per week for four continuous weeks to complete as much backfilling and reclamation work as possible on the Beachy property. Albeit against Mr. Beachy's wishes, Tri-Star Mining does not have to remove fuel tanks, haul roads or equipment until final reclamation is achieved as per the approved Coal Mine Permit.  No issues were observed on this site today.  Any questions regarding this inspection, please call this inspector at (301) 697-0344    "

This ongoing investigation into the iron discharge shows the iron levels in the discharge are up and down. On this date the flowing pit water showed iron levels of 10. This may be due to ongoing backfilling operations or the material handling. However, the operator is reminded that the effluent limits of their general discharge permit for iron are a maximum daily limit of 6 and an average monthly limit of 3. I discussed this with Ted and Troy and suggested that they install some temporary check dams where the water drains out the pit to help with retention time to allow the iron to precipitate before being discharged. They agreed and also stated that they are adding additional lime and ash material to the backfill and pit floor. Also the operator has recently cleaned the pond. In order to truck the material out the emergency spillway was disturbed.   Before my next inspection re-establish the rock rip-rap material in the emergency spillway in order to avoid a violation. The approved design calls for the spillway to be 24' wide with 2:1 side slopes.

At the time of this inspection, the pH was field tested at 6.5 and it is apparent that the iron levels are elevated. A Hach Field Test Kit was used and it revealed an iron content of greater than 10 ppm. Due to the elevated iron levels and the ph at 6.5, the iron is dropping out and staining the area. After talking with the previous inspector, Tom Murray, I was informed of an old deep mine entry from an abandoned deep mine workings in this general area. The annual maps for this permit also show the abandoned mine as well as pre-law surface mines in the general vicinity of the seep. Routine water sampling and stream monitoring reveals that there has been no impact on the receiving streams at this time. Pre-mining water samples were taken by Vindex Energy at location MK4. This sample location will be GPS located and compared to the GPS coordinates of the current seep to compare the proximities of the two locations. Vindex Energy has requested to monitor the seep and take samples of the seep as well as the receiving stream, both above and below the mixing zone. The sampling will be done periodically and all documentation will be forwarded on the Bureau of Mines. At such time, the Bureau will determine if Vindex Energy is responsible for the seep and if a NOVO is warranted. Vindex Energy will also be performing water sample ""Finger Printing"" of the current seep and comparing it to the seeps of pre-law deep mine workings that are throughout the area.           Vindex Energy has been taking samples and analyzing the surface and ground water of the area around the seep. Also, Vindex Energy has been researching the old pre-law mine maps of the area to try and determine the source. Today's meeting was to allow the Permitting Section of the BOM to see the seep first hand and to assist in the assessment of the seep and its origin. Vindex Energy will provide the BOM with the lab results and sampling data of all water samples taken. The site is active today with backfilling in progress and preparations are being made for seeding and mulching of several areas of the permit. Pond #3 is discharging, pH-7.7, Pond #5 is discharging, pH-6.2 and Pond #6 is discharging, pH-7.2.    Any questions regarding this inspection, please contact this inspector at (301)697-0344.   "

A seep of iron laden water was identified close to the location of the reclaimed Pond #7. At the time of this inspection, the pH was field tested at 6.5 and it is apparent that the iron levels are elevated. A Hach Field Test Kit was used and it revealed an iron content of greater than 10 ppm. Due to the elevated iron levels and the ph at 6.5, the iron is dropping out and staining the area. After talking with the previous inspector, Tom Murray, I was informed of an old deep mine entry from an abandoned deep mine workings in this general area. The annual maps for this permit also show the abandoned mine as well as pre-law surface mines in the general vicinity of the seep. Routine water sampling and stream monitoring reveals that there has been no impact on the receiving streams at this time. Pre-mining water samples were taken by Vindex Energy at location MK4. This sample location will be GPS located and compared to the GPS coordinates of the current seep to compare the proximities of the two locations. Vindex Energy has requested to monitor the seep and take samples of the seep as well as the receiving stream, both above and below the mixing zone. The sampling will be done periodically and all documentation will be forwarded on the Bureau of Mines. At such time, the Bureau will determine if Vindex Energy is responsible for the seep and if a NOVO is warranted. Vindex Energy will also be performing water sample ""Finger Printing"" of the current seep and comparing it to the seeps of pre-law deep mine workings that are throughout the area.

The contract operator Tri-Star Mining, was actively mining the Franklin coal seams today.  On 2/18/13 the Allegany Roads Dept. complained to Kerry Beener and also called G&S Coal and complained about water running out the haulroad and onto the county road. Ray Tighe called me and informed me about the complaint.  On this date I inspected the site and found that the entire drainage control system is covered with heavy snow and has been thawing due to warmer temperatures. Melting snow can be expected to leave the site at different locations until the drainage control facilities thaw. Almost all the properties alone this county road show signs of melting snow and water running out onto the county road. In fact, the county road side ditch is full of heavy wet snow and cannot function because of it. These conditions are to be expected during this type of weather condition.  Tri-Star has made the extra effort and put in some additional drainage breaks on the haulroad. During this investigation water was not running out the haulroad and onto the county road. No further investigation is needed for this complaint.  No problems were observed during this inspection.   "

At this time the Operator has placed a wooden plug to help slow down the water.  After the inspection this date and discussing with Al Hooker the Chief of Permitting and Jeff Snyder of the Permitting Section the Bureau of Mines is going to modify the existing Prospect Permit for the Operator to drill WCE-CAS-06-11 to regrout and hopefully seal as requested by Asa Maust.  Yesterday Asa located the drill hole on the surface, which the property owner is Butch Bittinger, and discussed with Butch the possibility of redrilling the bore hole.  Butch Bittinger stated to Asa that would not be a problem. Reviewed the drill log at the mine office and it appears it is approximately 436 feet from the surface to the coal seam.  It appears this bore hole is in Room 3 Section, # 3 heading, and between 13 and 14 block.
